## Wave Function Collapse
### Bevy - Rust
\
This project is an implementation
of the Wave Function Collapse algorithm,
written in Rust, using the Bevy game engine.
\
Specifically, this implementation uses a 
hard-coded ruleset, based on 
adjacency rules of the tileset.
\
For this structure I was inspired by this [project](https://github.com/CodingQuest2023/Algorithms/tree/main/WorldGeneration/WaveFunctionCollapse).
\
\
This was my first project written in Rust and 
I was learning the language as I went, 
therefore the structure and organization is probably
not compliant with how a Rust or Bevy project 
might be expected to look like.
